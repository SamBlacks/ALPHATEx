CHAP. I.

Of the Nature and Division of Logick.

Axiome 1. LOGICK is the Art of making of Instruments; and therewith directing the understanding in the Knowledge of Things.

There is yet an Homonymie, or Ambiguity of meaning, lies hid in this Word Logick; for it is used either for a natural Faculty of Discourse, as when Persons of little Learning or Understanding are said to use Logick or Discourse, when af-
ter their Manner; they question and maintain
Disputes. Or for a Habit obtain'd by frequent
Exercises and Rules. Or lastly, for a Systeme of
Logical Precepts; as when one says, The Logick of
Aristotle, The Logick of Ramus, &c. Logick in the de-
liver'd Definition, lest any one should mistake, is
taken for a Habit, which is as it were the End to
which Precepts are design'd.
Ax. 2. Logick of the third and last Acceptation, that
is, a System of Logical Precepts, consists of two
Parts, Theamatic and Organic.
Ax. 3. The first is that which is imply'd about
Theams, and their various Affections, and second
Notions, as about the Matter of the Instruments
of Logick.
Ax. 4. The other converses about the Organs
themselves, with which the Understanding en-
treats of Themes, and according to its Capacity
attains to the Knowledge of them.

C H A P. II.

Of Themes Simple and Composed, Uni-
versal and Singular.

Ax. 1. A Theme is whatsoever may be propos'd
to the Understanding to be known.
Ax. 2. Themes are either Simple or Composed.
Ax. 3. Themes Simple are those which are un-
derstood without a Composition or Complexion of
Notions, as Man, Horse, &c.
Ax. 4. Compos'd, such as are understood by two
or more Notions, by an Affirmation or Negation
join'd together, as Man runs.
(3)

A Complexion of Notions is nothing else but

an Affirmation or Negation in the Understanding

or Speech. And by this means are Themes Sim-

ple to be discern'd from Complex, and not by

the Multitude or Composition of Words: For a

Simple Theme is often express'd by a Compound

Word, as Common-wealth, Goat-Hart, &c. Frequent-

ly also by many Words, as, Love of Parents to-

wards their Children. Sometimes in one, and that a Sin-

gle Word, you have a Theme Complex; as when

I say, in Latin, pluit, ningit, tum, flatur; that is,

it Rains, it Snows, we go, ye stand, &c.

Ax. 5. A Theme Simple is either Universal or

Singular.

Ax. 6. A Universal is that which is apt of its

own Nature to be predicated of many things, as

Man, Horse, Plant, &c.

A Universal is said to be predicated of many

things either actually Existing, or at least such as

may Exist. So Man was a Universal when Adam

only was in being; because Man was not only apt

of its own Nature to be said of Adam, but of all

Men that were to be born. So altho' the Sun be

really but One, it may yet, that is, the Term Sun,

be call'd a Universal, because many Suns may be

made of the same Nature with this of ours.

A Universal is said to be of its own Nature

apt to be predicated; lest any one should think

Homonymous Words, or Words given to many

Singulars of the same Species; as, When many

Men are call'd Peter, to be Universals: For Ho-

monymous, as Homonymous, are predicated of ma-

ny as to their Names only; not Definitions, or, as

to their proper Natures.

Ax. 7. The Singular is that which of its own

Nature, is apt to be predicated only of One.

Ax. 8. Singulars are also call'd Individuals be-

cause not divisible into more of the same Name

and Nature: So Plato, altho' he may be divided

B 1

into
(4)

into Body and Soul, Head, Belly, Breast, Feet, and his other Members; yet cannot he be divided into more Plato's.

Art. 9. Individuals are either Determin'd or Vague; that is, Uncertain.

Art. 10. Individuals are determin'd four ways: first, by their Proper Names, as Alexander, Bucephalus, &c. And secondly, by a Common Name taken by way of Excellency, for their Proper; as Philosopher for Aristotle. Thirdly, by a demonstrative Pronoun, as this Man. Fourthly Periphrasis, as The Apostle of the Gentiles, for St. Paul.

Art. 11. An Uncertain Individual is that which is pronounc'd with a particular Pronoun; as Some Man, a certain Man, &c. by the Greek ὁ δεῖνα.

CHAP. III.

Of the Categories in general.

Art. 1. A Category is a Series of Things gradually dispos'd under the same chief Genus.

A Category is so call'd from the Greek Word κατηγορία, that is, to Accuse; for it was a Word us'd in the Forum, and from thence brought into the Schools, and signifies to say or affirm a Thing of any Body. But the School-men say Predicate. Farther, a Category either is taken for the Affirmation it self, or for the Series and Disposition of those things which may be affirmed of others under the same Genus. Such a Series Boethius calls a Predicament. We have chosen rather the Greek Word.

Art. 2. The Categories are Ten, Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Action, Passion, When, Where, Situation, and Habit.
( 5 )

Art. 3. Of which the one is of Substances, the rest of Accidents. This Number is taken from the diversity of Questions which may be made concerning the first and individual Substances, as appears from the very Appellations of the Categories.

Art. 4. In these Ten are contain'd all things which can be predicated of any Subject; others directly, others indirectly.

Art. 5. That which directly, requires these Five Conditions.

I. It must be a Finite Being.

By this Condition God is excluded out of the Categories: For altho' God be a Substance, yet is he not put in the Category of Substance; for those things which are directly plac'd in this Category, not only subsist of themselves, but are subject also to Accidents, as we shall hereafter make appear, which to think of God were impious. Besides, the Genus, properly so call'd, of those things which are directly plac'd in the same Category, must be the same: But neither Substance, nor anything else, can be the Genus properly so call'd of things Finite and Infinite: God therefore being Infinite cannot be directly contain'd under the Genus of Finite Substances. Yet is he equivocally revok'd to this Category. For Substance is the Genus equivocal both of God and Finite Substances.

II. True and Positive. To a true Being are oppos'd Beings of Reason, as Genus, Species, &c. which are by no means in Categories. 2dly. The fictitious or feign'd, as Chimeras, Centaurs, &c. which are referr'd to Categories Hypothetical, or by way of Supposition: For if a Centaur were that which it is feign'd to be, it would really be put in the Category of Substances. 3dly. Appearances, or, as they commonly say, Intentionals, as the Rain-bow, Colours appearing, Species and Spectres.
