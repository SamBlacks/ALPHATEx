A 
VOYAGE 
TO 
The World of Cartesius. 

PART. I.

It fares with the World of Monsieur Descartes, as with other lately discovered Lands, whereof such different Accounts are given, as often contradict one another. Scarce Mention was made of this New World, but an infinite Number of French, English and Dutchmen resolve to go see it. The Spaniard, however zealous for new Discoveries, understanding it was barren of Mines of Gold and Silver, of Indigo and Ginger, seemed not much concerned about it: Wherefore those that had most contributed unto it were not a little pleased, as believing, they had no Reason to apprehend the Inquisition’s coming there to disturb them. Among other

A Voyage to the

‘Things in that World the Earth takes a Turn about the Sun, as in that of Copernicus: And it is known that Ad, Descartes hath more than once,

on that occasion, reflected on the Misfortune of

poor Galileus, I cannot tell, but it may be on

his Account he hath taken so much Pains to prove

this Paradox, That the Earth stands still, though

at the same Time it is carried about the Sun by

that Luminary’s Vortex. Let it be how it will,

many of those that give out they have best exa-

mined that Country; have made their Relations

of it, but so differently, that a Man can scarce

yet determine what he must believe: If you will

credit one Party, they'll tell you, It is no World

at all, but a perfect Chaos: That all lie in Dis-

order, and wild Confusion: That 'tis impossible

for a Man to turn himself in it: That there is

neither Light nor Colours, neither Heat nor

Cold, Drought nor Moisture: That Plants and

Animals there don’t live. There you have not

only Liberty, but positive Orders to doubt of

every thing in Nature. Some there shall be that

will dispute you out of the Name of a Man;

though you have a Face like other Men; though

you be made up of Flesh and Bone as they;

though you Walk, and Eat, and Sleep, and,

in a Word, perform all the Natural Functions

of a Man; yet, I say, there are those that shall

contest that Title with you, until having con-

versed you, and understood you speak conse-

quentially, they shall be convinced that you have

Reason,

The Inhabitants look Proud and Scornful, and

have not the least Respect for Antiquity. Ari-

stotle, especially is scouted in all Companies, and

upon all Occasions, by them, being look’d

upon

Wold of Cartesius,

upon as a Vain Babler, and an Antique Teller

of Dreams. It is said, There is neither good

Christian nor good Catholic there, since they

tamper with Principles too Delicate and Dan-

gerous, in Matters relating to Religion. No

Body can tell what to make of their Belief of the

Creation of Our World, the Production of Matter

and the Providence of God; who, with them,

had no other Care upon him: than to order the

Cubical Particles of Matter to whirl about their

Center: After which he might sit Idle and

Unconcerned, since all the rest could be managed

without the least of his Assistance.

On the other Side, We are assured, A most

excellent Conduct shines through the whole Com-

position; That all is admirably contrived, and

founded upon the Rules and Laws of Nature:

That this World is indeed disburthened of an

infinite Swarm of Accidents, Qualities, and Inten-

tional Species; as of an unprofitable Lumber,

wherewith the Philosophers have imbroiled and

incumbered ours: But yet, notwithstanding it

cannot be deny’d, but the Senses are subject to

the same Impressions there as here, only: with

this Difference, that the Causes are more acknow-

ledged, and better explain’d.

As to the Point of Religion, nothing seems

more justifiable than the Apology of these

Gentlemen, which perhaps some have ingaged too

inconsiderately for an Affair of that Weight and

Moment. Can we apprehend a greater Idea of

God Almighty, than that which M Descartes

hath given? An Idea that he derived not from

the Visible Creatures, that sleight and faint Ray

of an infinitely perfect Being; but which his

Mind found impressed upon it self, and which

left no room for him to doubt of the Existence
of a Sovereign Being, though he possessed nei-
ther Heaven nor Earth, nor any Body, nor in-
deed any other Soul than his: Can the Omnipotence
of a Deity be advanced to a more transcendent
Degree than he hath done it? God,
according to him, "can cause, "That Two and
Three shall not make Five; "That four Sides shall
not be requisite to make a Square; "That the
Whole shall be no bigger than One of its Parts;
Effects that other Philosophers never scruple to
place out of the Reach of the Godhead. But
has not an Author of a little Piece, called, "A
Letter to a Learned Jesuite, clearly shewn,
"That 'tis Descartes' World that is described in the
first Chapter of Genesis? Another Book hath
since been published in Holland, with the Title
of Cartesian Medals, and is to the same effect.
The Author of the Treatise concerning The Influence
of the Stars, describes the End of the
World upon Descartes' his Hypothesis: Monsieur
Scottanus, in a late Apology, that he offered
for M. Descartes, against those that Endeavoured
to render him obnoxious to the Suspicion
of Atheism, observes to us, the Respect he had
for Religion, certifying us, "That one of his
Reasons for the reducing his Meditations to the
Number of Six, was the Consideration of the
Six Days which God employed in the Creation
of the World. If we may credit Father Mersennus,
a Learned and Noted Divine, and an
intimate Acquaintance of Descartes, we shall
find nothing of a more Christian Temper, and
that inspires us more ravishingly with the Love
of God than Descartes' Philosophy. In short,
there is nothing more edifying than the Letter

Gold of CARTESIUS,

that Philosopher wrote to the Sorbon Doctors, in,
dedicating his Meditations to them, which is so
true, that not long since, a Friend of mine, not
wont to be very Nice in those Matters, having
read by chance the Letter at my House, which
touched him; and finding farther the Title of
Meditations in the Front of the Work, he seriously
entreated me to lend him that Godly
Book, to entertain his Devotions during Passion
Week.

This so strange Variety of Opinions, and
Relations counter to one another, of a World,
otherwise of no little Renown, provoked, my
Curiosity, and induced me to be convinced of
the Truth or Falsity of the Reports, in my
own Person. All the Difficulty was to find a
Guide to conduct me to a Country, to which
there was no Road passable either for Horse or
Foot; for Coach or Barge, by Land or Sea:
But presently after my Resolve, I was happily
favoured with the most lucky Occasion that could
be wished, for the undertaking my Voyage with
all the Pleasure and Ease imaginable. Having
sojourned some Months in a Country Town,
I struck up Acquaintance with an Old Standard,
of about eighty Years, a Man of Parts, and that
formerly had conversed much with M. Descartes.
That Commerce had begot in him an unaccountable
Zeal for the Tenets of that Philosopher, and
exasperated him to declaim against the Method
and Opinions of the School, the Prejudices of
Childhood, and taught him to make external Eulogies
on the Cartesian Philosophy. He had so
given himself up to this Opinion, that he could
no ways suffer, in Point of Philosophy, any one
to deviate never so little from it. In a Conference
